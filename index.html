     <p> Negrete was born in the city of Guanajuato and had two brothers and three sisters; his father was a Mexican Army Colonel who fought with the Revolutionary faction called Northern Division (División del Norte);[3] however, around 1920, he quit his military career and moved with his family to Mexico City. There he found a job as a math teacher in several institutions, such as the German College "Alexander Von Humboldt"; there his sons David and Jorge studied until middle school, and as a result, they became fluent in the German language. Jorge learned other languages at the Heroico Colegio Militar (military academy of Mexico): English, French, and Italian. From an early age, Negrete demonstrated great brilliance and rapidly became a prominent student in the eyes of his teachers.</p>

      At the age of thirteen, because of Negrete's misbehavior, his father decided to enroll him in the military.[citation needed] He graduated with the rank of sub-lieutenant from El Colegio Militar. This was the place where his fascination for music developed. Not only did he develop an interest in music but his military training forged him a gallant presence and character which would later benefit him in his acting career. Negrete met and studied under José Pierson, a prestigious singing professor, who became fascinated the moment he heard Negrete sing. Pierson helped Negrete develop his talent for opera, and at the age of twenty Negrete began to sing for Radio XETR.</p>

      In 1953, during a business trip to Los Angeles, Negrete died of complications of hepatic cirrhosis, a disease that he suffered since 1937. According to his wishes, his body was flown back to, and buried in, Mexico City. He was forty-two years old.
